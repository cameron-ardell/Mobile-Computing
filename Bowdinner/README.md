## Break-Out
Assignment 4 for Mobile Computing Spring 2016

Works in portrait and landscape mode (not upside down though).

Only has one level with no adjustable settings (which was a bonus option anyway and it's finals week...). There are 4 types of bricks. The first three are "normal", they just vary in how many hits they take to break. Last type is special bricks, which take 1 hit, and release an item that if the paddle colides with as it falls to the bottom of the screen, adds a power up. The power ups are: adding extra ball, shrinking paddle width by 25% (unless paddle is less than 10% of width of screen), and increasing paddle width by 25% (unless paddle is greater than 45% of the width of the screen).
