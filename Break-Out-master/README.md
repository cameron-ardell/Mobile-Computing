# Break-Out
assignment 4 for Mobile Computing Spring 2016

Project is completely done for code and commenting!

Works in portrait and landscape mode (not upside down though).

Only has one level with no adjustable settings (which was a bonus option anyway and it's finals week...).
There are 4 types of bricks. The first three are "normal", they just vary in how many hits they take to break.
Last type is special bricks, which take 1 hit, and release an item that if the paddle colides with as it falls to the bottom of the screen, adds a power up.
The power ups are: adding extra ball, shrinking paddle width by 25% (unless paddle is less than 10% of width of screen), and increasing paddle width by 25% (unless paddle is greater than 45% of the width of the screen).
